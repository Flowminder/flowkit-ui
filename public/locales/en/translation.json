        "title": "Subscriber privacy information",
        "simple_text": "Globally, the number of mobile subscribers is continuously growing. People use mobile devices for calling and texting friends, browsing the internet or using mobile money. Once the data generated by the use of these devices are processed, aggregated, and anonymised to protect the privacy of subscribers, they can be used to generate important insights about population distributions and movement patterns. These insights can help target aid after a disaster or help improve public resource allocation policies and henceforth speed up the achievement of <a href=\"https://sdgs.un.org/goals\" target=\"_blank\">Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)</a>.\n\nThe collaboration between <a href=\"https://flowminder.org\" target=\"_blank\">Flowminder</a> and <a href=\"https://digicelgroup.com/ht/fr.html\" target=\"_blank\">Digicel Haiti</a>, which started in the aftermath of the 2010 earthquake, yielded this Haiti mobility dashboard. It provides access to anonymised information on population distributions and flows in Haiti in order to inform policies that will help Haiti meet its SDGs.\n\nThe population distribution and mobility indicators available through the dashboard only describe the changes in the distribution and mobility of groups of subscribers in an area as whole, preventing individuals from being identified or traced. The privacy of mobile phone subscribers is indeed central to this project. All indicators are anonymised and aggregated.\n\nThese indicators are produced using Call Detail Records (CDRs), a type of mobile operator phone data. These data are routinely used by Digicel Haiti for billing purposes, meaning no additional data is being collected or stored for the purpose of producing the indicators. \n\nCDRs are generated only when a subscriber uses their mobile device to make or receive a call, send or receive a message or use mobile data (we call these “network events”). CDRs only record the nearest cell tower (i.e. not the subscriber', 's exact location), and the content of the network events is not recorded: what is written in an SMS and said in a call is never recorded. You can find out more about CDR data <a href=\"https://flowgeek.org\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.\n\nTo preserve the security of subscribers', ' personal data, the CDR data remain behind Digicel Haiti', 's firewall (a type of cyber defence protecting IT systems from an external intrusion). Pseudonymised CDRs, which have had identifying information replaced with randomly generated values, are then transferred onto a Flowminder server, also installed  behind Digicel', 's firewalls in Haiti. The data are then aggregated, anonymised, scaled and adjusted on this server. Only then can these data be retrieved from behind the firewall to produce indicators requested by authorised users on the dashboard."

        "heading3": "**On this page, we will go through the various features of the dashboard, to make sure you get the most out of it, and use the data in a way that best suits your needs.**",
        "text3": "The data ingested into the dashboard comes from <a href=\"https://flowkit.xyz\" target=\"_blank\">FlowKit</a>, <a href=\"https://flowminder.org\" target=\"_blank\">Flowminder</a>'s toolkit for processing and analysing the pseudonymised Call Detail Records (CDR data) provided by Digicel Haiti.\n\nThe platform has been designed to facilitate use of the data, through user-friendly access and visualisation. You can therefore interact with the outputs, visualise different indicators and scenarios, before exporting the data (N.B.  Download feature is not available during the demo phase).\n\n\n\n**Accessing the dashboard**\n\nThe data dashboard can only be accessed if you have created an account and are logged in, regardless of the plan you subscribed to. Plans mostly affect the type of indicators, metrics and parameters you can choose from. Find out more about our plans [here](/pricing).\n\n\n\n**Selecting indicators**\n\nThe platform contains a large number of indicators, split across four main categories: Residents, Relocations, Daily presence and Daily movements\n\n1. Select a category of indicator\n\n2.Click on the dropdown list to select an indicator. This will load some default data. As default, the results will be displayed as a map. We will explain a bit below how to change the view.\n\n\n\n**Choosing parameters**\n\n\n\nParameters include selecting spatial and temporal resolution for your indicator. These vary from an indicator to another, and based on your plan.\n\n1. Once an indicator is selected, you will be able to set parameters for your selection.\n\n2. If a parameter is greyed out, this means that you require a Premium account to access such a level of granularity. To change plans, read the account management section of this tutorial\n\n3.Once parameters are selected, a new map will be loaded.\n\n\n\n**Understanding the indicators**\n\nIndicators are generated by processing anonymised and aggregated CDR data to adjust for variation in mobile network activity (i.e. changes in the frequency with which subscribers use their mobile phones). They are combined with other data (e.g. baseline values from a reference period) to provide more nuanced descriptions of population distributions and mobility. Indicators may also be adjusted to address representativeness biases.\n\n\n\nWe've put together some descriptions and explanations for each indicator, which you can access as follows:\n\n1. A short description of the selected indicator will appear at the top of the dashboard. This is to give you a brief overview of the data you are looking at.\n\n2. If you click on the blue side bar, on the left of the dashboard, you will see a more detailed description of the indicator, including a  brief explanation on how it is calculated.\n\n3. Finally, at the bottom of the sidebar, you will find a 'Read more' button. This will direct you to <a href=\"https://flowgeek.org\" target=\"_blank\">FlowGeek</a>, <a href=\"https://flowminder.org\" target=\"_blank\">Flowminder</a>'s knowledge centre on CDR analytics. There, you will be able to read a thorough description of the method and how the indicator is calculated and adjusted for. Information on use and limitations will also be available.\n\n\n\n**Visualising the data**\n\nDifferent visualisation modes are available: map, graph and table. The map view is selected by default. To change visualisation type:\n\n1. Log in and go onto the dashboard\n\n2. In the top right corner, you will see the map view icon.\n\n3. Click on the icon, until your preferred visualisation appears.\n\n\n\n**Downloading the data**\n\nDownloading the data is not available during the demo phase. Keep an eye on future developments. Once this feature is added, we will add here some information on how to download data from the dashboard. Watch this space!",
