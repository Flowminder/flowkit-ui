        "simple_text": "Globally, the number of mobile subscribers is continuously growing. People use mobile devices for calling and texting friends, browsing the internet or using mobile money. Once the data generated by the use of these devices are processed, aggregated, and anonymised to protect the privacy of subscribers, they can be used to generate important insights about population distributions and movement patterns. These insights can help target aid after a disaster or help improve public resource allocation policies and henceforth speed up the achievement of <a href=\"https://sdgs.un.org/goals\" target=\"_blank\">Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)</a>.\n\nThe collaboration between <a href=\"https://flowminder.org\" target=\"_blank\">Flowminder</a> and <a href=\"https://digicelgroup.com/ht/fr.html\" target=\"_blank\">Digicel Haiti</a>, which started in the aftermath of the 2010 earthquake, yielded this Haiti mobility dashboard. It provides access to anonymised information on population distributions and flows in Haiti in order to inform policies that will help Haiti meet its SDGs.\n\nThe population distribution and mobility indicators available through the dashboard only describe the changes in the distribution and mobility of groups of subscribers in an area as whole, preventing individuals from being identified or traced. The privacy of mobile phone subscribers is indeed central to this project. All indicators are anonymised and aggregated.\n\nThese indicators are produced using Call Detail Records (CDRs), a type of mobile operator phone data. These data are routinely used by Digicel Haiti for billing purposes, meaning no additional data is being collected or stored for the purpose of producing the indicators. \n\nCDRs are generated only when a subscriber uses their mobile device to make or receive a call, send or receive a message or use mobile data (we call these “network events”). CDRs only record the nearest cell tower (i.e. not the subscriber', 's exact location), and the content of the network events is not recorded: what is written in an SMS and said in a call is never recorded. You can find out more about CDR data <a href=\"https://flowgeek.org\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.\n\nTo preserve the security of subscribers', ' personal data, the CDR data remain behind Digicel Haiti', 's firewall (a type of cyber defence protecting IT systems from an external intrusion). Pseudonymised CDRs, which have had identifying information replaced with randomly generated values, are then transferred onto a Flowminder server, also installed  behind Digicel', 's firewalls in Haiti. The data are then aggregated, anonymised, scaled and adjusted on this server. Only then can these data be retrieved from behind the firewall to produce indicators requested by authorised users on the dashboard."

Indicators may also be adjusted to address representativeness biases.\nWe've put together some descriptions and explanations for each indicator, which you can access as follows:\n1. A short description of the selected indicator will appear at the top of the dashboard. This is to give you a brief overview of the data you are looking at. **[1]**\n2.
